## Engineering Standards

Our development practices are governed by engineering standards designed to ensure **reliability, security, and maintainability** at enterprise scale.

### Secure Development Principles

- **Security by Design** — Security considerations are integrated from the earliest stages of system design, not retrofitted after deployment.
- **Least Privilege Access** — All system components and personnel operate under the principle of minimum necessary permissions.
- **Data Protection** — Encryption at rest and in transit, with strict adherence to data privacy regulations and internal compliance mandates.
- **Code Review & Static Analysis** — Every merge request undergoes peer review and automated static analysis before integration.
- **Dependency Management** — Continuous monitoring of third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities and license compliance.

### Code Quality & Architecture

- Clean Architecture and SOLID principles
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD) for complex business domains
- Comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end testing
- Structured logging and centralized observability
- Versioned APIs with backward compatibility guarantees
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for reproducible environments

## Development Workflow

Our engineering workflow follows an industry-standard GitFlow-based model with integrated automation:
